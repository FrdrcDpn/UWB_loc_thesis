# particle_oriented

Basic accelerated particle with kinematic equations and orientation.

It is represented as a triagle in the direction of the orientation.

It expects the control inputs to be the velocity along x (local frame, i.e., forward) and the yaw rate.
For the same agent that expects the inputs to be the velocities along x and along y, please check the modified controller `particle_oriented_xy`.
